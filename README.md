# CS370_Portfolio

For this project, I developed an intelligent pirate agent that would be able to navigate a maze and find the treasure using Q-learning. I was given teh starter code for the environment (TreasureMaze.py), experience replay (GameExperience.py), and a partially completed jupyter notebook. I created the full Q-Training algorithm myself, trained the model, and adjusted the exploration strategies to optimize the agent's performance.

Computer science is about solving problems through logic, creativity, and technology. In this project, I used AI tehcniqies to teach a machine how to learn from experience, which show the core of what computer scientists do: building solitions that adapt and improve over time. Approaching this problem required breaking it down, testing ideas, learning from failures, and steadily improving the solution. 

Ethically, it is important to make sure that the solutions that I build are fair, reliable, and respectful of the users and the organizations I support. Intelligent agents, like any sort of software, must be created carefully so they ebenfit people without causing harm accidentally.
